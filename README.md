# DiSCO-coders

## Introduction

Has coding ever felt impossible? Like you have no idea what's going on, or where the bug in your code is?

This repository is here to give you the basics of coding in one of the most accessible coding languages: **Python!**

**Motivation:** Learning to think like a programmer is one of the largest barriers to success in STEM courses at St.Olaf. For example, introductory physics labs move quickly through coding concepts, without having you think deeper about the code and how the computer reads it. To make physics and other STEM majors more equitable to students entering the department without coding experience, this hopes to be a fun, approachable guide to all the basics of thinking like a coder.
